|---|---|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| CITY | VARCHAR2(21)   |

*Sample Input*

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

ABC 3 

PQRS 4

*Explanation*

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3,3,4,3,3,4, and 33. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 33 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

```sql
SELECT City, LENGTH(City) FROM Station ORDER BY LENGTH(City), City LIMIT 1;
SELECT City, LENGTH(City) FROM Station ORDER BY LENGTH(City) DESC, City LIMIT 1;
```

# **[Higher Than 75 Marks](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/more-than-75-marks/problem)**

Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
